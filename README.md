# Alpaca
Simple CMS System based on Laravel Framework.

Requirements:
* Laravel Framework
* Bootstrap 4
* VueJs

## Why a new CMS system again?

I'm just frustrated with the system that's on the market.

**Wordpress**: Security issues (security updates), Hook system for modules is a real challenge  
**Drupal8**: Slow, Cache, Complex (Field data attributes)   
**OctoberCMS**: Pages will saved as a file, PHP Code is complex, Twig template system
